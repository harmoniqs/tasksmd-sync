# Tasks

## Todo

## In Progress

### Implement label syncing for items
<!-- id: PVTI_lADOC9ysqc4BETyazglCOOI -->
Ensure that labels defined in TASKS.md are correctly synchronized with the
corresponding GitHub Issues. This includes:
- Resolving label names to IDs within the correct repository context.
- Adding missing labels to issues.
- Removing labels that are no longer present in TASKS.md.

## Done

### When moving tasks back from archive + done, issue remains closed but status updates
<!-- id: PVTI_lADOC9ysqc4BETyazglCVcc -->

### When moving tasks back from archive + done, --archive-done flag does not seem to be idempotent and requires a follow up run without the flag
